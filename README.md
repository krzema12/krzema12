### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Piotr KrzemiÅ„ski. I'm a software development engineer, passionate about software quality and constant process improvement. I work full-stack, mainly with JVM languages and React. My programming languge of choice is Kotlin which I use for both backend and frontend. I try my best to write [clean](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) code.

I also have a obsessive-compulsive disorder to come up with ideas for computer programs. This GitHub stores some of them, in various state of completion. Enjoy!
