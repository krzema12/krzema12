### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Piotr KrzemiÅ„ski. I'm a software development engineer, passionate about software quality, automation and constant process improvement. I work full-stack, mainly with JVM languages and React. My programming languge of choice is Kotlin which I use for both backend and frontend, and which I try to spread through [a local Kotlin User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tricity-kotlin-user-group/). I try my best to write [clean](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) code.

In the open-source world, I own an ecosystem of projects for creating type-safe GitHub workflows:
* [github-workflows-kt](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt) - a Kotlin-based DSL for defining GitHub Actions workflows
* [github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing) - add typings to your actions' API. Used by the above DSL
* [github-actions-typing-catalog](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing-catalog) - a catalog of action typings, if their owners decide to not use [github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing) to host the typings together with the actions
